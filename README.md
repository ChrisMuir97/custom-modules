# Custom Modules

This repository contains examples of Custom Modules for Azure Machine Learning. This feature lets you create components that solve specific problems in your machine learning workflows. For example, you could create a component for data preparation, model training or model evaluation. The benefit of this is that components can be used in your Designer workflows for use cases that aren't supported out-of-the-box, and components can be made available for use by the wider organisation who may not have the skills to solve these problems themselves.
