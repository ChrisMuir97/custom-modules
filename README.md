# Custom Modules

This repository contains examples of Custom Modules for Azure Machine Learning. Custom Modules let you create components that solve specific problems in your machine learning workflows. For example, you could create a component for data preparation, model training or model evaluation. The benefit of this is that components can be used in your Designer workflows for use cases that aren't supported out-of-the-box, and the components are re-usable for the wider organisation. 

Prophet:
Prophet is a forecasting procedure out of Facebook. Forecasting is a common challenge across different departments within an organisation. Sales, Marketing, Finance and other departments typically carry out forecasting. This Custom Module can be implemented by the Data Science team and made available for a wide range of users to utilise in a drag'n'drop manner from the Azure Machine Learning Designer.
