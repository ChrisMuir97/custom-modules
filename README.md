# Custom Modules

This repository contains examples of Custom Modules for Azure Machine Learning. Custom Modules let you create components that solve specific problems in your machine learning workflows. For example, you could create a component for data preparation, model training or model evaluation. The benefit of this is that components can be used in your Designer workflows for use cases that aren't supported out-of-the-box, and the components are available for use by the wider organisation.
