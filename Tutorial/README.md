# Tutorial 1: Use existing components

A component is self-contained set of code that performs one step in machine learning pipeline, such as data preprocessing, model training, model scoring and so on. A component is analogous to a function, in that it has a name, parameters, expects certain input and returns some value. Any python script can be wrapped as a component following the [component spec](https://github.com/chris-muir/AzureMachineLearningGallery/blob/main/tutorial/component-spec-definition.md).
