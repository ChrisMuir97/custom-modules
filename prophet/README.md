Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. The tool is available in Python and R.

Forecasting is a common data science challenge across various departments within an organisation. Sales, Marketing and Finance (among others) typically carry out forecasting procedures on a daily basis for use cases such as capacity planning and goal setting. Creating trustworthy forecasts is crucial in effective decision-making at all levels of business.
