# Prophet

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. 

Forecasting is a common challenge across various departments within an organisation. Sales, Marketing and Finance (among others) typically carry out forecasting procedures for different reasons. This Custom Module for Prophet can be implemented and made available for use by a wide range of users in forecasting use cases through the Azure Machine Learning Designer.
